    <h2>About Cassidy</h2>
    <%= image_tag("poetree-and-cassidy.jpg", class:"poetree-and-cassidy") %>
    <p>Cassidy Kao is a 14-year-old author who enjoys writing, dancing, and reading. She wasn’t very interested in writing until her mother introduced her to poetry when she was 8 years old. During National Poetry Month (April) of that year, she wrote at least one poem a day and posted each poem as a leaf on what became her “PoetTree.” When her PoetTree became too big to fit on her wall, Cassidy thought it would be fun to publish a book with all of her poems as a way to teach other kids everything she learned about poetry. Her first book is called Roller Coaster: A Kid’s Guide on How to Write Poetry. Her second book is Constellation Exploration, Greek Mythical Stories Retold with Simple Facts and Fun and Mysterious Riddles, a book primarily about constellations with a bit of poetry mixed in. Cassidy has since written and published two other books and continues to develop her love of writing.

While writing her books, Cassidy realized how much fun it was to write. She knew there were lots of kids who didn’t enjoy writing, just like she didn't before she was introduced to poetry. So, she made it her mission to inspire young reluctant writers through poetry and show them that writing can be fun. Four years ago, she developed an original curriculum and started teaching local students in poetry workshops at schools and libraries. She has received much positive feedback about her teaching and her passion for helping kids discover their love of writing. Cassidy created iPoetTree in order to help even more kids see how much fun writing and poetry can really be.

One year ago, Cassidy started another project: Mathematical Poetry. It combines her two favorite subjects, you guessed it, math and poetry! Cassidy knows that there are a lot of kids that only like writing, math, or neither. Through this new curriculum, she hopes to help kids start to like a new subject by giving it a new perspective and combining it with another subject. She has already made some progress! She has collaborated with the Institution of Education Advancement, (check out one of her Virtual Learning Labs <a style="color:#15ad3d" src="https://educationaladvancement.org/blog-virtual-learning-lab-mathematical-poetry-topology/">here</a> and her new once-monthly series <a style="color:#15ad3d" href="https://go.educationaladvancement.org/l/781173/2020-08-26/2mbg3">here</a>!) and she is teaching her own class as a junior instructor with <a style="color:#15ad3d" href="https://athenasacademy.com/courses/mathematical-poetry-junior-instructor-middle-semester/">Athena’s Advanced Academy</a>.
